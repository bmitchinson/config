# Config + DotFiles

My configuration for zsh + git.

Setup is MacOS / Linux supported

### Instructions

Run the following for ohmyzsh before setup:

- `git clone git@github.com:bmitchinson/config.git ~/repos`
- `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- restart your shell so it loads ohmyzsh before running setup
